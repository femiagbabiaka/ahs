This projects aims to ease the configuration of AWS EC2 instances hostname.
In particular when they are launched as part of ASGs or fleets.

## TL;DR

```bash
# Using instance-id method
~$ ahs instance-id

```

You can also use a containerized version if you prefer:

```bash
~$ docker run -it --rm --privileged mvisonneau/ahs <instance-id|sequential>
```

## Install

Have a look onto the [latest release page](https://github.com/mvisonneau/ahs/releases/latest) and pick your flavor.

### Go

```bash
~$ go install github.com/mvisonneau/ahs/cmd/ahs@latest
```

### Homebrew

```bash
~$ brew install mvisonneau/tap/ahs
```

### Docker

```bash
~$ docker run -it --rm --privileged mvisonneau/ahs
```

### Binaries, DEB and RPM packages

For the following ones, you need to know which version you want to install, to fetch the latest available :

```bash
~$ export AHS_VERSION=$(curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/mvisonneau/ahs/releases/latest" | grep '"tag_name":' | sed -E 's/.*"([^"]+)".*/\1/')
```

```bash
# Binary (eg: linux/amd64)
~$ wget https://github.com/mvisonneau/ahs/releases/download/${AHS_VERSION}/ahs_${AHS_VERSION}_linux_amd64.tar.gz
~$ tar zxvf ahs_${AHS_VERSION}_linux_amd64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin

# DEB package (eg: linux/386)
~$ wget https://github.com/mvisonneau/ahs/releases/download/${AHS_VERSION}/ahs_${AHS_VERSION}_linux_386.deb
~$ dpkg -i ahs_${AHS_VERSION}_linux_386.deb

# RPM package (eg: linux/arm64)
~$ wget https://github.com/mvisonneau/ahs/releases/download/${AHS_VERSION}/ahs_${AHS_VERSION}_linux_arm64.rpm
~$ rpm -ivh ahs_${AHS_VERSION}_linux_arm64.rpm
```

## Usage

```bash
~$ ahs
NAME:
   ahs - Set the hostname of an EC2 instance based on a tag value and the instance-id

USAGE:
   ahs [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

COMMANDS:
   instance-id  compute a hostname by appending the instance-id to a prefixed/base string
   sequential   compute a sequential hostname based on the number of instances belonging to the same group
   help, h      Shows a list of commands or help for one command

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --dry-run              only display what would have been done (default: false) [$AHS_DRY_RUN]
   --help, -h             show help (default: false)
   --input-tag tag        tag to use as input to determine the hostname (default: "Name") [$AHS_INPUT_TAG]
   --log-format format    log format (json,text) (default: "text") [$AHS_LOG_FORMAT]
   --log-level level      log level (debug,info,warn,fatal,panic) (default: "info") [$AHS_LOG_LEVEL]
   --output-tag tag       tag to update with the computed hostname (default: "Name") [$AHS_OUTPUT_TAG]
   --persist-hostname     set /etc/hostname with generated hostname (default: false) [$AHS_PERSIST_HOSTNAME]
   --persist-hosts        assign generated hostname to 127.0.0.1 in /etc/hosts (default: false) [$AHS_PERSIST_HOSTS]
   --separator separator  separator to use between tag and id (default: "-") [$AHS_SEPARATOR]
   --version, -v          print the version
```

### InstanceID method

This method basically takes the output of a tag considered as the `base` of the hostname, it appends a separator to it (default to `-`) and finally a truncated value of the instance-id (default to `5 characters`).

```bash
~$ ahs instance-id -h
NAME:
   ahs instance-id - compute a hostname by appending the instance-id to a prefixed/base string

USAGE:
   ahs instance-id [command options]  

OPTIONS:
   --length value  length of the id to keep in the hostname (default: 5) [$AHS_INSTANCE_ID_LENGTH]
```

### Sequential method

This method allows you to have sequential hostnames on instances on which you couldn't or haven't configured at the time of provisioning.

```bash
~$ ahs sequential -h
NAME:
   ahs sequential - compute a sequential hostname based on the number of instances belonging to the same group

USAGE:
   ahs sequential [command options]  

OPTIONS:
   --instance-group-tag value          tag to use in order to determine which group the instance belongs to (default: "ahs:instance-group") [$AHS_INSTANCE_GROUP_TAG]
   --instance-sequential-id-tag value  tag to which output the computed instance-sequential-id (default: "ahs:instance-id") [$AHS_INSTANCE_SEQUENTIAL_ID_TAG]
   --respect-azs                       if instances are provisioned through an ASG, setting this flag it will get the sequential-ids associated to respective azs (default: false) [$AHS_RESPECT_AZS]
```

## Develop

You can have a look at the [Makefile](/Makefile) in order to see all available options:

```bash
~$ make
all                            Test, builds and ship package for all supported platforms
build                          Build the binaries using local GOOS
clean                          Remove binary if it exists
coverage                       Generates coverage report
coverage-html                  Generates coverage report and displays it in the browser

help                           Displays this help
install                        Build and install locally the binary (dev purpose)

lint                           Run all lint related tests upon the codebase
prerelease                     Build & prerelease the binaries (edge)
release                        Build & release the binaries (stable)
setup                          Install required libraries/tools for build tasks
test                           Run the tests against the codebase
